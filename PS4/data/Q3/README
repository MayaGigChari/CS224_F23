This directory contains two datasets:

1.mixture1.*
Contains data from a mixture model with 2 components (i.e. populations)
Use this data to test your implementation.

mixture1.geno contains genoytpes for 1000 haploid individuals at 250 SNPs (1000 rows and 250 columns)
mixture1.freq is the allele frequency in each of the two populations (F; rows = number of SNPs, columns = number of populations)
mixture1.ganc indicates which population each individual belongs to (Z; rows = number of individuals, columns = number of populations)


2. mixture2.geno contains the genotype data for 1000 individuals at 250 SNPs
